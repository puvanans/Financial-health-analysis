# Financial-Health-Analysis

#### Data Pipeline project

My first Data Engineering project.

I hope to build a data pipeline which will:

- Access data from the AlphaVantage API
- Prepare data using Python (pandas)
- Warehouse the prepared data (Google BigQuery)
- Obtain data from the database and analyze it (Python & SQL)
- Visualize the final output (Plotly or Shiny (TBD))

I will be using Google Colab as opposed to the Jupyter-lab in my local machine.
